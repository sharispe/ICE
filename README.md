Abstract. Automatic elicitation of implicit evocations - i.e. indirect references to entities (e.g. objects, persons, locations) - is central for the
development of intelligent agents able of understanding the meaning of
written or spoken natural language. This paper focuses on the definition and evaluation of models that can be used to summarize a set of
words into a unique unambiguous entity identifier selected from a given
ontology; the ability to accurately perform this task being a prerequisite
for the detection and elicitation of implicit evocations on spoken and
written contents. Among the several strategies explored in this contribution, we propose to compare hybrid approaches taking advantages of
knowledge bases (symbolic representations) and word embeddings defined from large text corpora analysis. The results we obtain highlight
the relative benefits of mixing symbolic representations with classic word
embeddings for this task.
